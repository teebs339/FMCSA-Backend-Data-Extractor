This project is an **RPA bot built with UiPath** that extracts backend data from [ai.fmcsa.dot.gov](https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/) for different trucking LLCs.

It uses **HTTP requests** to pull company data, applies **RegEx** to parse and transform the raw HTML into a human-readable format, and outputs the results into a neat **Excel report**.

A built-in **VBA script** automatically applies formatting to the final Excel file, so you get a polished report out of the box.

## Features

* Automates data retrieval from FMCSA backend.
* Parses and cleans data with **regular expressions**.
* Generates a formatted **Excel report** with VBA styling.
* Simple input file structure for easy customization.

## Requirements

* [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/) installed on your machine.
* Microsoft Excel with macros enabled.
