This project is an **RPA bot built with UiPath** that extracts backend data from [ai.fmcsa.dot.gov](https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/) for different trucking LLCs.  

It uses **HTTP requests** to pull company data, applies **RegEx** to parse and transform the raw HTML into a human-readable format, and outputs the results into a neat **Excel report**.  

A built-in **VBA script** automatically applies formatting to the final Excel file, so you get a polished report out of the box.
